This is a smart contract implementation, using the blockchain course github repository. In this example, you are both node A and node B
For it to work, you have to run the 'smart_contract.py' file.
 - First, it creates the two nodes.
 - Node A sends you a smart contract.
 - After that it validates the contract.
 - Type in a message you want to send.
 - It will upload into the contract and encrypt it using the node A public key.
 - After this, using node A's private key you can see the message in the contract.
